1) installed go manually since version 13.0 DOESN'T SUPPORT 'modules'


    - First removed apt installed go : $ sudo apt remove go*
    - Download the tar file for linux from the site https://golang.org/dl/ (obtained file go1.14.linux-amd64.tar.gz)
    - Change to Downloads folder : $ cd ~/Download
    - Execute the command $ sudo tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.14.linux-amd64.tar.gz
    - In the file ~/.bash_aliases add the following lines (if doesn't exist is ok to create it with : $ touch ~/.bash_aliases):

        export GOROOT="/usr/local/go"
        export GOBIN="$HOME/go/bin"
        mkdir -p $GOBIN
        export PATH=$PATH:$GOROOT/bin:$GOBIN


2)I'm using the local working directory :

  ~/go/src/github.com/clutso/ttn-app

3) installed ttn client by :

  $ go get github.com/TheThingsNetwork/go-app-sdk
